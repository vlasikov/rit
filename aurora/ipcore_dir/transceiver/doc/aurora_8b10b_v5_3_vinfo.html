7. OTHER INFORMATION

  7.1 Quick start recommendations
  ---------------------------
  After generating an Aurora module, you may want to do one of the
  following:
  
  (a) Build an Aurora module to try the flow and see it working in
      simulation
  
  (b) Integrate the Aurora module with your own design
  
  (c) Remember to set pin constraints in &lt;component_name&gt;_aurora_example.ucf
      file before using the aurora_example design
  
  The User Guide explains the Aurora module in detail to help you connect it 
  to your design and use it in your system.
    
  7.2 Troubleshooting Guide
  ---------------------
  This section presents some common problems you may encounter with
  the Aurora 8B/10B design.
  
  (a) Lanes and Channel do not come up in simulation
  
  - The quickest way to debug these problems is to view the signals from
    one of the GT instances that are not working.
  
  - Make sure that the GT reference clock and user clocks are all toggling.
    Note that only one of the reference clocks should be toggling, 
    the rest will be tied low.
  
  - Check to see that TXOUTCLK from GT wrapper is toggling.
    If they are not toggling, you may have to wait longer for the PMA to
    finish locking. You should typically wait about 6-9 us for lane up 
    and channel up. Need to wait longer for simplex designs. 
  
  - Make sure that TXN and TXP are toggling. If they are not, make sure
    you've waited long enough (see the previous bullet) and make sure 
    you are not driving the TX signal with another signal.
  
  - Check the PLL_NOT_LOCKED signal on your design. If it is held active 
    high, your Aurora module will not be able to initialize.
  
  - Be sure you do not have the POWER_DOWN signal asserted
  
  - Make sure the TXN and TXP signals from each GT are connected to the
    appropriate RXN and RXP signals from the corresponding GT on 
    the other side of the channel
  
  - If you are simulating Verilog, you will need to instantiate the
    "glbl" module and use it to drive the power_up reset at the 
    beginning of the simulation to simulate the reset that occurs
    after configuration. You should hold this reset for a few cycles.
    The code below can be used an example:
  
    //Simulate the global reset that occurs after configuration at
    //the beginning
    //of the simulation.
    assign glbl.GSR = gsr_r;
    assign glbl.GTS = gts_r;
  
    initial
      begin
        gts_r = 1'b0;
        gsr_r = 1'b1;
        #(16*CLOCKPERIOD_1);
        gsr_r = 1'b0;
      end
  
  - If you are using a multilane channel, make sure all the GT on
    each side of the channel are connected in the correct order

  (b) Channel comes up in simulation but TX_DST_RDY_N is never asserted
      (never goes low)
  
  - If your module includes flow control but you are not using it, make
    sure the request signals are not currently driven low. 
    NFC_REQ_N and UFC_TX_REQ_N are active low: if they are low,
    TX_DST_RDY_N will stay high because the channel will be allocated
    for flow control
  
  - Make sure WARN_CC and DO_CC are not being driven high continuously. 
    Whenever DO_CC is high on a positive clock edge, the channel is used 
    to send clock correction characters, so TX_DST_RDY_N is deasserted
  
  - If you have NFC enabled, make sure the design on the other side of
    the channel did not send an NFC XOFF message. This will cut off 
    the channel for normal data until the other side sends
    an NFC XON message to turn the flow on again. See ug353.pdf for more
    details


  (c) Bytes and words are being lost as they travel through the Aurora
      channel

  - If you are using the LocalLink interface, make sure you are writing
    data correctly. The most common mistake is to assume words are written
    without looking at TX_DST_RDY_N. Also remember that all signals
    ending in _N are active low, and that the REM signal must be used to
    indicate which bytes are valid when TX_EOF_N is asserted.

  - Make sure you are reading correctly from the RX interface. Data and
    framing signals are only valid when RX_SRC_RDY_N is asserted.
  
  
  (d) Problems while compiling the design
  
  - Make sure you include all the files from the src directory when
    compiling
  
  - If you are using VHDL, make sure to include the aurora_pkg.vhd file 
    in your synthesis
